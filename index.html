            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro">I am currently a stay at home mom to two children. I completed my undergrad work at Angelo
                State
                University with a degree in Business Marketing. It was during my time as a stay at home mom I decided
                I would like to learn how to write code and pursue a career in programming.

                <h3>Communication and Customer Relation Services</h3>
                <p>I have six plus years of experience, working in a
                    professional business environment. The bulk of
                    those
                    years were at Enterprise Rent A Car and TrueCar. Both positions required a level of customer
                    service. This skill goes hand in hand with good communication. I have excellent verbal, non verbal
                    and written
                    communication skills. </p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>I started programming in 2023 after staying at home with my
                    kids for four years. Since
                    starting my coding bootcamp I have gained experience in html and css.
